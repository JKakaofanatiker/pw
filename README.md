# pw
Password generator written in python

The passwords always have upper and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols.

## Why is this a thing?

Many websites, apps, etc. allow passwords containing upper and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols which is good.

I normally use pwgen to generate passwords. But always typing many flags (like -y) annoys me and I wanted to learn something so I created this.
