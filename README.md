# pw
Password generator written in python

The passwords always have upper and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols.

## Example:

Enter password length:

60

Here is your password:

1a#q%6=L\D#d4XpWu,<X@n&4?bcG~6$ItbOr!u>?Gy&&S"@aB8N_pa.USb?]

## Binaries:

You can find a Linux binary and a deb package under [Releases](https://github.com/JKakaofanatiker/pw/releases).

## Why is this a thing?

Many websites, apps, etc. allow passwords containing upper and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols which is good.

I normally use pwgen to generate passwords. But always typing many flags (like -y) annoys me and I wanted to learn something so I created this.
